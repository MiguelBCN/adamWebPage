            Eliminate the Hassle of Planning Planning tools are terrible. We
            know that. They are clunky and make you do it. And instead of
            solving problems, they become the problem. So we did something
            different. We took away the junk. And focused on the key features
            your team actually uses day-to-day to prospect, stay organized, we
            synchronize with your Google Calendar and we show you the tasks on a
            periodic basis.
